### Miss Viduitas

<blockquote>
There is no more lively sensation than that of pain; its impressions are certain and dependable, they never deceive

***The Marquis de Sade.***

I am the girl your mother warned you about. Enchantingly dark and delightfully devious, I revel in being sadistic and take great pleasure in what I do.

I favour the Gothic aesthetic both inside the dungeon and out in the 'real' world; I'm slender with pale skin and long dark hair. I have a number of large tattoos and various piercings, so if you like women of an alternative persuasion, I do not disappoint.

        <h3>A Tribute</h3>

<blockquote>
I have that broken glass feeling, a scratching inside of my veins, my blood even hurts and She can tear me to shreds, it is Lucina. That flush skin, dripping sweat, causing that intense heat and iced chill, it is Lucina. Tormented restless nights with no sleep in sight, confusing head spins taking me off course, making me wish for things i don't really want, but want all the same in equal measure, it is the fear, it is Lucina. That weakness deep in my soul, pulling at me, directing me, even when I cry tears and don't want to follow, I can't fight back, it is Lucina. When I try to stand tall my knees want to buckle, to bring me to Her feet. Every ounce of strength I have isn't enough to hold me, it is Lucina. When my thoughts are not my own anymore and I feel like that puppet on a string I know that is Lucina. When my heart has bled dry and nothing is left it will be because of Lucina, but i will still feel those sharp claws digging and twisting at me, my Princess, Lucina. When my flesh feels as if it is on fire I will offer more fuel and beg for the pain not to leave me. She controls every inch of me. Oh!! How I can feel Lucina inside of me. When I feel the rage of hell, bringing ecstatic torture, wrapping me up and taking me over I can hear Her taunting me to take more. Lucina, I will look in the mirror, take in every detail, realise where I belong, because I will become the person I have always needed to be. When the ache in my cock and balls becomes so overwhelming and I feel as if I am going insane I will choose to ignore it and suffer even more because Lucina is inside me.

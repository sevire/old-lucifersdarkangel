Firstly, some notes on slave etiquette

### Punctuality
Be on time ! You must factor in any potential delays before planning your journey. Keep Me informed of unforeseen developments which may affect your appointment. Remember My time is precious. Do not waste it!

### Approach
You will approach Me with appropriate humility. I expect to be addressed as Princess or Princess Lucina at all times. Brattishness is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. It will not gain you further punishment - I will simply refuse to see you.

### Communication
Give some advance thought to what you would like to achieve from your session. Be open and honest with Me and yourself. Above all else, be realistic - fantasy can sometimes be different than the reality of your submission, once you find yourself at My feet. These are particularly important issues for those who have not sessioned with Me previously.

Your special time with Me will always be preceeded by a non-tributable consultation. W/we will discuss and assess your limitations and cover any pre-existing medical conditions. I encourage feedback and am interested in your post session thoughts and opinions.

### Hygiene
You will shower or bathe prior to your appointment. I expect you to be clean and presentable. Those who do not follow this fundamantal rule, will show a lack of respect, resulting only in dismissal.

### Tribute
You will offer Me the appropriate tribute upon arrival. My preference is for this to be presented at My feet in a sealed envelope, marked “Princess”

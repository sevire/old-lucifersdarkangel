              <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
              have that broken glass feeling, a scratching inside of my veins, 
              my blood even hurts and She can tear me to shreds, it is Lucina. 
              That flush skin, dripping sweat, causing that intense heat and iced 
              chill, it is Lucina. Tormented restless nights with no sleep in 
              sight, confusing head spins taking me off course, making me wish 
              for things i don't really want, but want all the same in equal measure, 
              it is the fear, it is Lucina. That weakness deep in my soul, pulling 
              at me, directing me, even when I cry tears and don't want to follow, 
              I can't fight back, it is Lucina. When I try to stand tall my knees 
              want to buckle, to bring me to Her feet. Every ounce of strength 
              I have isn't enough to hold me, it is Lucina. When my thoughts are 
              not my own anymore and I feel like that puppet on a string I know 
              that is Lucina. When my heart has bled dry and nothing is left it 
              will be because of Lucina, but i will still feel those sharp claws 
              digging and twisting at me, my Princess, Lucina. When my flesh feels 
              as if it is on fire I will offer more fuel and beg for the pain 
              not to leave me. She controls every inch of me. Oh!! How I can feel 
              Lucina inside of me. When I feel the rage of hell, bringing ecstatic 
              torture, wrapping me up and taking me over I can hear Her taunting 
              me to take more. Lucina, I will look in the mirror, take in every 
              detail, realise where I belong, because I will become the person 
              I have always needed to be. When the ache in my cock and balls becomes 
              so overwhelming and I feel as if I am going insane I will choose 
              to ignore it and suffer even more because Lucina is inside me. <br>

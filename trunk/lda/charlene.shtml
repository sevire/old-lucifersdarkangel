Lady Nicole.... Cheshire and North West Mistress
I am a well established Mistress with years of experience, a wealth of knowledge and understanding of BDSM . whether you are a novice or well travelled, wishing to push your boundaries to find yourself and your limits, my warped mind and constant fascination of exploring the depths of depravity is something I will never tire of. Watching you helpless and vulnerable, making you my plaything is what excites me and can be one of the most enjoyable and emotional experiences you may have.....my reviews will give you an insight into the type of sessions I conduct.
I am a stylish brunette in my 30’s. My interests in this unusual yet exciting world of BDSM were born 9 yrs ago, when my then partner asked me to tie him up, as he put it, “just for a laugh”. Far from being shocked, I found it intriguing and was only too willing to indulge his fantasies. Once I had him bound and gagged, he became a different person. His brash, chauvinistic attitude disappeared, replaced with a new, compliant persona, responsive to my needs.
At 23 yrs old I learnt the art of real control. I pushed the boundaries further than he ever envisaged. Tie and tease became as normal as vanilla sex, but I wanted more excitement.
I subjected him to feminization, strap on play, strict elaborate bondage, mummification, breath play and introduced him to my favourite toy, a multi tailed flogger. Our role plays became quite involved, sometimes taking him outdoors, restrained in the boot of my car.
The physical and mental high I experienced was far beyond anything I had ever known. I discovered my love of fetish wear, especially rubber, the most intoxicating of all materials. Fine hosiery and boots became an everyday apparel. The power trip was all mine, the expense was all his.
He had no choice. I had indulged his fantasies, now he had to satisfy mine. The path of enlightenment was firmly mapped out by me.
The partner has long since gone, but my desires still remain. It is this reason I have decided to continue to explore and indulge in the BDSM world as a Pro Domme.

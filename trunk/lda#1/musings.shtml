              Today was not the first time I had sessioned with Princess Lucina. 
              I first came across her web site about six months ago and from the 
              moment i saw the pictures of her clad in her SS Uniform I was captivated. 
              After an exchange of e mails I arranged a visit. It was wonderful. 
              Everything and more than I had hoped for.<br>
              <br>
              The second visit was even better and so today I made my third pilgrimage. 
              I had already supplied a detailed scenario. I was to play the role 
              of a captured British agent in Nazi occupied Europe. As I sat in 
              my cell clutching my trousers around my waist (They had taken away 
              my belt) I resolved that I would not give away my contact details 
              and relied heavily on my religiious beliefs to help me .Soon I was 
              ushered into the presence of the beautiful &quot;Major Monika&quot;<br>
              <br>
              With a cruel smile she ordered me to&quot; put my hands on my head&quot;. 
              As I did so my trousers dropped slowly to my ankles. As she flicked 
              her crop around my cock and balls she to;d me how stupid and undignified 
              I looked. I certainly felt it! Bravely I gave her my name rank and 
              serial number and told her I could and would not tell her anything 
              else. Laughing she looked me in the eyes and promised &quot;that 
              before the day was out I would be licking her boots and begging 
              for mercy. NEVER! I replied. Soon I was secured to the whipping 
              bench. I gritted my teeth as her crop beat a tattoo of pain across 
              my buttocks. Eventually the beating stopped. Lifting my head she 
              looked into my eyes again. &quot;This is just a warm up &quot; she 
              smiled. Ready to talk ?&quot; I shook my head. &quot;NO<br>
              <br>
              Next I found myself on the upright whipping frame. Despite my terrible 
              predicament I could not ignore her dark beauty or the teasing glimpse 
              of cleavage that nestled in the V of her uniform jacket. Tying a 
              lenght of strong cord arround my balls she began to viscously pull 
              and stretch my balls to the absolute limit. &quot;Contact name password 
              telephone number&quot; she asked over and over again. Still I resisted.<br>
              Now she lit a candle and as she waited for the wax to form she repeated 
              her questions. The hot wax was excruciating. Eventually to give 
              myself some respite I gave her my password (not much use without 
              the name and phone number). Still the wax dripped onto my cock and 
              that cruel smile never left her face.<br>
              <br>
              After a while the &quot;Major&quot; told me she required some lunch 
              and would be back soon. &quot;Don't go away&quot; she called laughingly 
              over her shoulder. I don't know how long I hung there it seemed 
              an eternity. My throat was parched and my body ached. The sound 
              of booted feet in the hallway heralded her return and I was consumed 
              with terror. She carried a glass of water. Taking a sip she asked 
              me if I would like some. &quot;Please &quot;I nodded. With a wicked 
              grin she threw the lot in my face. &quot;More questions first I 
              think&quot;.<br>
              Now I found myself on the interrogation bench. &quot;What now I 
              &quot;wondered. My question was soon answered as she began to attach 
              electodes to my cock. There were still traces of water on my body. 
              This could be interesting she giggled noticing the droplets that 
              lingered near my cock and balls. I could feel my resolve slipping 
              quickly away. I was right ! Questions followed by jolts of electricity 
              and still her beautiful face was wreathed in cruel smiles. I'm ashamed 
              to say I told her evrything but still it continued. &quot;Just making 
              sure&quot; she smiled almost apologetically.<br>
              <br>
              When I was finally released I did what she promised I would. I licked 
              her boots. I begged for mercy. Willing to do anything rather than 
              face more pain. Her smile was now one of tirumph as she led me through 
              a series of utterly degrading tasks.<br>
              Finally she prodded my tortured cock with her crop. &quot;Entertain 
              me &quot; She palced her hand on the black electrics box...&quot;Unless&quot; 
              Utterly broken. I took my cock in my hand. &quot;Go on &quot; said 
              smirking. DO IT !!! <br>

              Hello Princess Lucina. Thank you very much again for our session 
              on yesterday. I'm sorry I couldn't e-mail you last night. I had 
              some problems with my internet connection.<br>
              <br>
              You are very beautiful. The pictures on your website look great, 
              but they don't do you justice. I was very nervous when I arrived, 
              but you made me feel comfortable, which I am also very grateful 
              for. I would also like to thank you for giving me so much of your 
              time, not only for the session itself, but with speaking to me on 
              the telephone before-hand and of course helping me to find my way 
              to you.<br>
              <br>
              I have received the pictures. Thank you for these also. I will have 
              a look at the website in a couple of days as you said. Eek! Once 
              again, thank you for both your kindness and cruelty.( An experience 
              I shall never forget ). I would love to see you again soon. This 
              will probably have to be post-xmas though :-( Rest assured, I will 
              let you know as soon as I am able to visit again.<br>
              <br>
              Take care of yourself. Speak to you soon. Love Slave Paul xxxx<br>

              <br>
              My Princess Lucina, I am writing to let you know how much I enjoyed 
              our last session and cannot wait until the next.<br>
              <br>
              Princess you are an exceptionally beautiful domme and despite your 
              youth you are very experienced - the best I have experienced.<br>
              <br>
              Princess you are very tactile and you communicate all the time with 
              your beautiful eyes and sensual voice.<br>
              <br>
              Princess I liken our sessions to a sensual roller coaster. You take 
              me to levels I have not experienced before &#150; a wonderful balance 
              of sensual and painful sensations. Absolutely wonderful. However 
              you take great care to build up slowly but when you want, Princess, 
              the pain can be severe, but you do it such a nice, almost soothing, 
              way.<br>
              <br>
              Princess, you are wonderful but even more wonderful in your catsuit 
              &amp; cape. I love to worship you all over wearing your lovely catsuit. 
              You are so powerful in your swishy cape and I love to serve you 
              in any way I can.<br>
              <br>
              Princess I am here to please you and I will seek to do this better 
              every time we meet.<br>
              <br>
              Princess, until next time&#133;<br>
              <br>
              Your loyal slave phil<br>
